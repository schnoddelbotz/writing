# Writing & Language

> Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Writing 
> (but were afraid to ask)

[Woody Allen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0YAuOiLBM)

"So kurz wie möglich, so ausführlich wie nötig."
As brief as possible - as detailed as needed.
That's one of the German quotes you may find here
as my attempt to support someone (or you) in writing
meaningful documents. Intent is to get you good grades
or whatever other positive response from your "sponsor".

A short, loose collection of hints on how to write.

## Introduction - From homeworks to academic writing

I put this document together for a friend who asked me
to help him write a 6-page article for school. I am
no educator but had to write a 100-page document myself
once and did not totally fail. So YMMV meaning your milage
may vary. Use my hints at your own risk.

I refuse ghostwriting but love to help, if I can.
Wish Dave the best.

If you're going through this adventure with me for the
first time, you'll need 6 sheets of paper. Yes.
I just decided 6 is good. I name them #S1 to #S6.
Maybe we can use 4-6 for airplanes in the end.

And you also need a pencil for you.
And one for your buddy, should you brainstorm together.
That's the point. Brainstorming as team is fine.
But YOU MUST WRITE THE FINAL TEXT. Imagine I, as German
would write for a Refugee in Switzerland. Nobody would
be helped. (I don't - just to let you see: Cheaters get caught).

## The task

It must be clear at this stage what kind of document you are
supposed to produce. Here are some common german examples ..

- Aufsatz
- Erörterung 
- Interpretation
- ...
- Dissertation

Each document type has some STANDARD outline and contents the
reader WILL expect. Keep both in mind till the end to win.

Blah blah bla
